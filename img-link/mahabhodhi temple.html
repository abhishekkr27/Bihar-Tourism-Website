            The Mahabodhi Temple (literally: "Great Awakening Temple") or the Mahabodhi Mahavihar, a UNESCO World
            Heritage Site, is an ancient, but much rebuilt and restored, Buddhist temple in Bodh Gaya, marking the
            location where the Buddha is said to have attained enlightenment. Bodh Gaya (in Gaya district) is about 96
            km (60 mi) from Patna, Bihar state, India.

            The site contains a descendant of the Bodhi Tree under which Buddha gained enlightenment, and has been a
            major pilgrimage destination for Hindus and Buddhists for well over two thousand years, and some elements
            probably date to the period of Ashoka (died c. 232 BCE). What is now visible on the ground essentially dates
            from the 7th century CE, or perhaps somewhat earlier, as well as several major restorations since the 19th
            century. But the structure now may well incorporate large parts of earlier work, possibly from the 2nd or
            3rd century CE.

            Many of the oldest sculptural elements have been moved to the museum beside the temple, and some, such as
            the carved stone railing wall around the main structure, have been replaced by replicas. The main temple's
            survival is especially impressive, as it was mostly made of brick covered with stucco, materials that are
            much less durable than stone. However, it is understood that very little of the original sculptural
            decoration has survived.

            The temple complex includes two large straight-sided shikhara towers, the largest over 55 metres (180 feet)
            high. This is a stylistic feature that has continued in Jain and Hindu temples to the present day, and
            influenced Buddhist architecture in other countries, in forms like the pagoda.
