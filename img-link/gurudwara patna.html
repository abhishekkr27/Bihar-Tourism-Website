            Takht Sri Patna Sahib also known as Harmandir Sahib, is a Gurdwara in the neighbourhood of Patna Sahib,
            India. It was to commemorate the birthplace of Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Guru of the Sikhs on December
            1666. It was built by Maharaja Ranjit Singh (1780-1839), the first Maharaja of the Sikh Empire, who
            also built many other Gurdwaras in the Indian subcontinent. The current shrine of Patna Sahib or Takht Sri
            Harmandirji Sahib was built in the 1950s.

            Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Sikh Guru, was born in Patna, Bihar, on 22 December 1666. He also spent
            his early years here before moving to Anandpur Sahib. Besides being the birthplace of Guru Gobind Singh,
            Patna was also honored by visits from Guru Nanak Dev Ji as well as Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji.

            Patna Sahib railway station, a railway station with same name located nearby, is connected to many
            metropolitan cities of India by the Howrah-Delhi Main Line.
