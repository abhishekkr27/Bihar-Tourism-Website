            The Sabhyata Dwar or Civilization Gate is a sandstone arch monument located on the banks on River Ganga in
            the city of Patna in the Indian state of Bihar. The Sabhyata Dwar is built with a Mauryan-style architecture
            with a purpose to show the ancient glory of Pataliputra and traditions and culture of the state of Bihar.
            The monument was first envisioned by the former Lieutenant General Srinivas Kumar Sinha. The 32 metres (105
            ft) high structure is taller than Gateway of India by 6 metres (20 ft) and was built at a cost of â‚¹ 5 crore
            (50 million). The monument is spread over an area of one acre within the campus of Samrat Ashok
            International Convention Centre. The arches of the Dwar contain inscriptions attributed to Megasthenes,
            Ashoka, Buddha and Mahavira. Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar inaugurated the monument on 21 May 2018.
