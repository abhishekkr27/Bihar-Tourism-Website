            Rajgir (historically known as Girivraj) is an ancient city and a notified area in Nalanda district in the
            Indian state of Bihar. The city of Rajgir (ancient Rājagṛha; Pali: Rājagaha) was the first capital of the
            kingdom of Magadha, a state that would eventually evolve into the Mauryan Empire. The city finds mention in
            India's greatest literary epic, the Mahabharata, through its king Jarasandha. Its date of origin is unknown,
            although ceramics dating to about 1000 BC have been found in the city. The famous 2,500-year old Cyclopean
            Wall is located in the city. This area is also notable in Jainism and Buddhism. It was the birthplace of the
            20th Jain Tirthankar Munisuvrata, and is closely associated with the arihant Mahavira and Gautama Buddha.
            Both Lord Mahavira and Lord Buddha taught their beliefs in Rajgir during the 6th and 5th century BC. The
            ancient Nalanda university was located in the vicinity of Rajgir, and the contemporary Nalanda University
            named after it was founded in 2010 at Rajgir. It was also through Rajgir that the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka
            travelled to Bodh Gaya around 250 BC, when placing the diamond throne (Vajrasana) at the great temple where
            Lord Buddha attained enlightenment.
