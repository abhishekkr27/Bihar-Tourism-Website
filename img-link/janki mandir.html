            About 1.5 Kms. Off the railway station and the bus stand, this is the birth place of Sita. Janaki-Kund is
            adjacent south of the temple. The shrine is thronged by devotees in thousands during Navratri and Ram Navami
            festivals. It is believed that this temple is some 100 years old.

            The legend of this place refers to the epic Ramayana and famous as the place where Sita was nursed under a
            shade in the ploughing filed where she was found as a new born by the King Janaka. This is a fairly big
            temple with a modern structure. The presiding deity of the temple is Sri Ram, Sita and Hanuman. A nearby
            tank famous as Janki Kund is where the King Janaka used to give bath to the baby Sita as is the belief of
            popular mythical tale. There is a big courtyard and provision for solar powered lights.

            The large gateway of the temple warmly welcomes the visitors to this sacred place. Inside there is a
            spacious courtyard to accommodate a large gathering of devotees. As the impact of Ramayana is a predominant
            influence on the Hindus in Bihar, the temple is thronged by devotees around the year. The festival Ram
            Navami and Janki Navami are the holy festivals of this place.
